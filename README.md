# Alteron: The Decentralized Intelligence Network

## Overview

### Introduction

**Alteron** is a decentralized intelligence network powered by Bittensor, designed to transform decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-protocol ecosystems through advanced automation and intelligence. Starting as a **proof of concept (PoC)** focused on vault optimization, Alteron enables miners to analyze and predict key metrics for governed vaults while suggesting actionable parameter updates. Over time, Alteron will evolve into a comprehensive strategy network addressing tasks like yield optimization, cross-chain token bridging, and portfolio rebalancing.

Alteron provides tools to optimize risk parameters, facilitate cross-protocol interactions, and maximize capital efficiency by leveraging dynamic data-driven models. By combining predictive insights with adaptive updates, Alteron ensures smarter decision-making for vault owners and DeFi participants.

## Proof of Concept (PoC) Framework

### Input to Miners
Miners in the Alteron network receive prompts to provide probabilistic forecasts for specific metrics related to vault performance. Each prompt includes the following parameters:
- **Vault Address**: The governed vault for which predictions are required.
- **Metric**: The target metric to predict, such as utilization rate, interest rate optimization, or liquidity trends.
- **Time Increment (Δt)**: The interval between predictions (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours).
- **Time Horizon (T)**: The total period over which predictions are required (e.g., 24 hours).
- **Number of Simulations (N)**: The number of probabilistic paths miners must generate for the specified metric.

Example Prompt:
- Vault Address: `0x1234...abcd`
- Metric: Utilization Rate
- Time Increment: 1 hour
- Time Horizon: 12 hours
- Number of Simulations: 100

Miners must return their predictions before the specified start time, adhering to the required format.

### Output from Miners
Miners provide probabilistic forecasts that include:
- **Simulated Paths**: Multiple paths showing the predicted evolution of the target metric over the specified time horizon.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence intervals or distributions for their predictions.
- **Parameter Suggestions**: Recommendations for vault parameter adjustments (e.g., interest rate changes, LTV adjustments) based on their forecasts.

While not all parameter suggestions can be directly executed or validated, the data from these recommendations will be aggregated over time to provide deeper insights into the relationship between key metrics and market conditions. This aggregated understanding will be valuable for refining models and identifying high-performing miners.

Example Output:
- Predicted Utilization Rates:
  - Path 1: [70%, 75%, 80%, 85%]
  - Path 2: [68%, 73%, 79%, 83%]
- Confidence Interval: [65%, 85%]
- Suggested Adjustment: Increase interest rate to 1.5% to optimize utilization.

### Validation and Scoring
Validators in the Alteron network evaluate miners’ outputs by comparing their forecasts to actual vault performance at the end of the time horizon. The evaluation process includes:

#### Scoring Methodology
1. **Accuracy**: Measured using probabilistic scoring rules such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which evaluates the closeness of the forecast to the observed outcomes.

2. **Timeliness**: Ensuring miners’ submissions are within the required timeframe.

3. **Performance History**: Miners with a strong track record of accurate forecasts will have their parameter suggestions carry more weight in future analyses and aggregated insights.

#### Normalized Scoring
Scores are normalized using a softmax function to ensure relative performance is highlighted. This approach emphasizes differences in performance among miners, rewarding those with better predictions.

---

### Leaderboard and Emissions
#### Leaderboard Scoring
Miners’ leaderboard scores are calculated as an exponentially decaying time-weighted average of their past normalized scores. This ensures that recent performance has more influence on their current ranking.

#### Emissions Allocation
Daily emissions are distributed proportionally based on leaderboard scores. An amplification factor is applied to reward higher-performing miners more significantly, encouraging consistent high-quality predictions.

### Insights from Aggregated Data
Over time, the Alteron network will build a comprehensive dataset linking metrics to market behavior based on miners’ predictions and parameter suggestions. This dataset will:
- Enable more accurate modeling of market dynamics.
- Provide actionable insights for protocol owners to refine governance parameters.
- Highlight miners who consistently perform well in forecasting, making their suggestions increasingly meaningful.

By focusing on aggregated insights, Alteron ensures long-term value creation beyond immediate scoring and reward distribution.
